    <main>

    <h3 class="right">ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَـٰلَمِينَ</h3>

    <p>The ultimate, genuine, sincere, and timeless praise and thanks is for Allah who is independent from His creation. Who is the Master, the Owner, the One who is in control and in charge, the One who allows us to grow and develop, the One who takes care of us and sustains us, the One who is improving us constantly, the One who gives us gifts over and over again for every generation, every culture, every nation, every people in every time and every place.</p>

    <h3>What dua can you make from this ayah?</h3>

    <p>O Allah! Assist me in remembering You, in thanking You, and in worshipping You in the best of manners.</p>

    <h3>What advice is Allah personally giving you in this ayah?</h3>

    <p>Allah is advising me to be grateful to Him for all the gifts that He has bestowed upon me. For indeed everything I have is a gift from Allah.</p>

    <h3>What question does this ayah raise for you?</h3>

    <p>If Allah is my Master than what does make me?</p>

    <p>I am the slave of Allah so I must enslave myself to Allah 24/7. Because a slave is a slave all the time. We often limit our relationship with Allah to worshippers of Allah instead of slaves. A worshippers worships sometimes but a slave obeys the Master always.</p>

    <h3>How does this ayah have an affect on you for a moment in your life?</h3>

    <p>It allows me to be grateful, more positive in life, and become more optimistic. One day I was driving and I pulled over to look for some place to open my fast. I took the exit and looked to my left and found a masjid. I went inside then opened my fast with the rest of the community. So I thanked Allah for granting me the opportunity to pray in His blessed house and for providing for me.</p>
