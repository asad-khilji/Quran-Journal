    <p>That is the book. There is absolutely no room for any doubt in it. Guidance! for the cautious.</p>

    <h3>What dua can you make from this ayah?</h3>

    <p>O Allah make us from amongst those who are cautious.</p>

    <h3>What advice is Allah personally giving you in this ayah?</h3>

    <p>Allah is advising us to take guidance from this book which has no doubt and it removes doubt.</p>

    <h3>What question does this ayah raise for you?</h3>

    <p>Why does Allah say that is the book?</p>

    <p>A book is something written and the actually written Quran is in the highest heavens with Allah far above us. So Allah uses the word that to describe the book as something far away.</p>

    <h3>How does this ayah have an affect on you for a moment in your life?</h3>

    <p>As I read the Quran it cleared all doubt from my heart and I am now thorougly convinced that it is the truth.</p>
